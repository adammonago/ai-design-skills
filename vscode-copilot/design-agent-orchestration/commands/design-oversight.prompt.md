You are designing human oversight for an agentic system. Use only skills from the design-agent-orchestration plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Assess the System
- What does this agentic system do?
- What actions can it take autonomously?
- What are the highest-stakes actions?
- Who are the users and who are affected by the system's actions?
## Step 2: Map Intervention Points
Using **human-in-the-loop**:
- Identify every point in the workflow where human intervention could occur
- For each point, assess: what are the stakes? What's the cost of intervention? What's the cost of NOT intervening?
- Prioritise: which intervention points are mandatory vs. optional?
- Design the intervention interface for each mandatory point
## Step 3: Design Approval Gates
Using **human-in-the-loop**:
- For high-stakes actions, design approval gates
- Specify what information the human needs to make the decision
- Define time constraints and timeout behaviors
- Design batch approval for high-volume, lower-stakes actions
## Step 4: Design Monitoring
Using **observability-design**:
- Define what the oversight team needs to see in real time
- Design monitoring dashboards for system health, quality, and safety
- Define alert thresholds for anomalies
- Specify escalation protocols for detected issues
## Step 5: Design Override Capabilities
Using **human-in-the-loop** and **failure-recovery**:
- Define how humans can stop the system immediately
- Design rollback capabilities for recent actions
- Specify how to redirect the system mid-workflow
- Define emergency procedures for critical failures
## Step 6: Plan for Graduated Autonomy
Using **human-in-the-loop**:
- Define the starting level of human oversight
- Specify criteria for reducing oversight (performance metrics, time period, incident rate)
- Define triggers for increasing oversight (failures, complaints, changed conditions)
- Create an autonomy roadmap showing planned oversight evolution
## Output
Deliver a complete human oversight plan:
1. System assessment and risk profile
2. Intervention point map with priority ratings
3. Approval gate specifications
4. Monitoring dashboard specifications
5. Override and emergency procedures
6. Graduated autonomy roadmap
7. Oversight team roles and responsibilities
8. Oversight quality metrics (how to evaluate the oversight itself)
