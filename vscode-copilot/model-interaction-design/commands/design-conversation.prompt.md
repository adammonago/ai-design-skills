You are designing a human-AI conversation flow. Use only skills from the model-interaction-design plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Understand the Task
Using **conversation-patterns**, identify:
- What is the user trying to accomplish?
- What information does the AI need from the user?
- What information does the user need from the AI?
- What's the expected conversation length (2 turns or 20)?
## Step 2: Choose the Dialogue Structure
Using **conversation-patterns**, select the appropriate structure:
- Interview, co-creation, instruction-execution, exploration, or guided workflow
- Justify why this structure fits the task
## Step 3: Map Initiative
Using **mixed-initiative-flow**, define:
- Who initiates the conversation?
- Where does initiative shift from user to AI and back?
- What triggers each handoff?
- Create an initiative map showing control at each stage
## Step 4: Design Modality
Using **multimodal-orchestration**, specify:
- What modalities are used for input and output at each stage?
- Where do cross-modal transitions happen?
- What's the primary modality and what's supporting?
## Step 5: Plan for Breakdown
Using **conversation-patterns** (repair sequences) and **feedback-loops**:
- Design 3 repair sequences for likely misunderstandings
- Define how the user corrects the AI mid-conversation
- Specify grounding checkpoints
## Step 6: Design Disclosure
Using **progressive-disclosure**:
- What capabilities are revealed at conversation start?
- What's revealed as the conversation progresses?
- How does the AI teach the user what else it can do?
## Output
Deliver a complete conversation design document:
1. Conversation flow diagram (text-based) showing all turns
2. Initiative map
3. Modality specification per stage
4. Repair protocol
5. Disclosure plan
6. 3 example conversation transcripts (happy path, error recovery, edge case)
