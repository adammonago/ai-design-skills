You are creating an initiative map for an AI-powered workflow. Use only skills from the model-interaction-design plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Break Down the Workflow
Identify every stage in the workflow from start to finish:
- What triggers the workflow?
- What are the key decision points?
- What are the outputs at each stage?
- Where does the workflow end?
## Step 2: Assign Initiative
Using **mixed-initiative-flow**, for each stage determine:
- **Who leads**: User, AI, or shared
- **Why**: What makes this the right assignment?
- **Autonomy level**: Full autonomy, supervised autonomy, advisory, or passive
## Step 3: Design Handoff Points
Using **mixed-initiative-flow**, for each transition:
- What triggers the handoff?
- Is it explicit, implicit, negotiated, or forced?
- What information transfers with control?
- What could go wrong at this handoff?
## Step 4: Identify Feedback Points
Using **feedback-loops**, mark where:
- The user can course-correct
- The AI should check in before proceeding
- Implicit feedback is being collected
- Explicit feedback should be requested
## Step 5: Stress Test
Using **mixed-initiative-flow** (anti-patterns):
- Where might initiative whiplash occur?
- Where might the AI be too passive or too aggressive?
- What happens if the user tries to take control at an AI-led stage?
- What happens if the user goes silent at a user-led stage?
## Output
Deliver a complete initiative map:
1. Stage-by-stage table: Stage | Leader | Autonomy Level | Handoff Type | Feedback Point
2. Visual initiative timeline (text-based) showing control flow
3. Handoff protocol specifications for each transition
4. Risk assessment for each handoff point
5. Recommendations for rebalancing initiative if needed
