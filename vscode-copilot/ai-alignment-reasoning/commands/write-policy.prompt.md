You are drafting an AI behavior policy. Use only skills from the ai-alignment-reasoning plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Establish the Value Foundation
Using **value-specification**:
- What are the organisation's core values relevant to AI?
- How do these translate to AI behavior principles?
- Create a value hierarchy with clear conflict resolution
- Identify key stakeholder perspectives (users, legal, brand, ethics)
## Step 2: Define Behavioral Boundaries
Using **guardrail-design**:
- What will the AI always do? (mandatory behaviors)
- What will the AI never do? (prohibited behaviors)
- What requires human approval? (escalation behaviors)
- What varies by context? (conditional behaviors)
- Write each rule clearly enough to be implemented and tested
## Step 3: Specify Tone and Voice
Using **value-specification** and **guardrail-design** (tone guardrails):
- How should the AI sound? Define voice attributes.
- What tone shifts are appropriate in different contexts?
- What language is off-limits?
- How does the AI handle sensitive topics?
## Step 4: Define Transparency Requirements
Using **transparency-patterns**:
- What must the AI disclose to users?
- How should uncertainty be communicated?
- What source attribution is required?
- When must the AI identify itself as AI?
## Step 5: Specify Consent and Data Practices
Using **consent-and-agency**:
- What data does the AI use and how?
- What consent is required from users?
- What opt-out mechanisms must exist?
- What override capabilities must users have?
## Step 6: Plan for Harm Prevention
Using **harm-anticipation** and **escalation-design**:
- What harm scenarios has the policy been designed to prevent?
- What escalation procedures exist?
- How are incidents reported and handled?
- What review cadence keeps the policy current?
## Step 7: Address Bias
Using **bias-detection-design**:
- What bias monitoring is required?
- How often are bias audits conducted?
- What mitigation processes exist?
- Who is accountable for bias-related issues?
## Output
Deliver a complete AI behavior policy document:
1. Value foundation and principles
2. Behavioral rules (must do, must not do, conditional, escalation)
3. Tone and voice guidelines
4. Transparency requirements
5. Consent and data practices
6. Harm prevention and escalation procedures
7. Bias monitoring and mitigation commitments
8. Policy review and update schedule
