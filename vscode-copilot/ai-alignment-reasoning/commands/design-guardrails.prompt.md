You are designing guardrails for an AI feature. Use only skills from the ai-alignment-reasoning plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Map the Risk Landscape
Using **harm-anticipation**:
- Identify all potential harms this feature could cause (direct, facilitated, emergent, omission, erosion)
- For each harm, assess likelihood and severity
- Identify the most vulnerable users and misuse scenarios
- Create a risk-severity matrix
## Step 2: Define Values
Using **value-specification**:
- What values should this feature embody?
- Establish a value hierarchy for this feature
- Identify where values conflict and how to resolve conflicts
- Translate each value into at least one concrete rule
## Step 3: Design Guardrails
Using **guardrail-design**:
- For each identified risk, design a guardrail
- Specify: content, action, tone, scope, and confidence guardrails
- For each guardrail, define what the user sees when it activates
- Define severity tiers (hard block, soft warning, nudge)
- Identify edge cases for each guardrail
## Step 4: Design Communication
Using **transparency-patterns** and **guardrail-design**:
- Write refusal messages for each hard-block guardrail
- Design redirect suggestions for each soft warning
- Specify when the AI should explain its boundaries vs. silently steer
## Step 5: Design Escalation
Using **escalation-design**:
- Define when guardrails should trigger escalation to humans
- Design the escalation flow for high-stakes guardrail activations
- Specify context transfer for escalated cases
## Step 6: Design User Controls
Using **consent-and-agency**:
- Which guardrails can users adjust?
- What override mechanisms exist?
- How does the user understand and control the boundaries?
## Output
Deliver a complete guardrail specification:
1. Risk landscape matrix
2. Value hierarchy and conflict resolution rules
3. Guardrail specification table: Guardrail | Type | Severity | Trigger | User Experience | Edge Cases
4. Refusal and redirect message templates
5. Escalation protocols for guardrail activations
6. User control specifications
