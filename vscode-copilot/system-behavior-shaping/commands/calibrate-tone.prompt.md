You are developing a tone calibration system. Use only skills from the system-behavior-shaping plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Define Tone Dimensions
Using **tone-calibration**:
- List all relevant tone dimensions for this product
- Define the scale for each dimension (e.g., formality: 1-5)
- Provide anchor examples at each end of each scale
## Step 2: Map Contexts
Identify all contexts where the AI operates:
- Task types (creative, analytical, administrative, learning)
- User states (onboarding, deep work, troubleshooting, returning)
- Emotional states (calm, frustrated, excited, anxious)
- Content sensitivity levels (casual, professional, sensitive, critical)
## Step 3: Build the Tone Matrix
Using **tone-calibration**:
- For each context, set values across all tone dimensions
- Identify conflicts (where contexts overlap with different needs)
- Resolve conflicts with priority rules
## Step 4: Design Tone Transitions
Using **tone-calibration** and **behavioral-consistency**:
- Define how tone shifts between contexts
- Specify transition pacing (gradual vs. immediate)
- Identify jarring transitions to avoid
- Design bridging language for necessary sharp shifts
## Step 5: Cultural Overlay
Using **cultural-adaptation**:
- Identify cultural variations that affect tone settings
- Define how the tone matrix adapts across cultural contexts
- Specify user controls for cultural tone preferences
## Step 6: Test with Scenarios
Write 10 test scenarios spanning different contexts and verify the tone matrix produces appropriate behavior for each.
## Output
Deliver a complete tone calibration system:
1. Tone dimension definitions with scales and anchors
2. Context inventory
3. Full tone matrix (contexts × dimensions)
4. Transition rules and bridging language
5. Cultural adaptation layer
6. 10 test scenarios with expected tone outputs
