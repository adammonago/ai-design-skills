You are designing a benchmark suite for ongoing AI quality measurement. Use only skills from the evaluation plugin.
Follow this process:
## Step 1: Define Benchmark Goals
- What does this benchmark need to measure?
- What decisions will benchmark results inform? (model updates, prompt changes, feature launches)
- What's the measurement cadence? (daily, weekly, per-release)
## Step 2: Design the Golden Test Set
Using **output-quality-rubrics** and **longitudinal-measurement**:
- Define input categories that cover key use cases
- Create 20-50 representative test inputs spanning:
  - Common use cases (high frequency)
  - Edge cases (high risk)
  - Known failure modes (regression detection)
  - Diverse user profiles and contexts
- For each input, define the expected quality standards
## Step 3: Define Metrics
Using **task-success-metrics**, **user-satisfaction-signals**, and **output-quality-rubrics**:
- Select metrics to track: quality scores, task success rates, failure rates, latency
- Define how each metric is calculated
- Set baselines from current performance
- Define acceptable ranges and alert thresholds
## Step 4: Design Failure Monitoring
Using **failure-taxonomy**:
- Define which failure types to track
- Set severity-specific thresholds (e.g., zero tolerance for critical safety failures)
- Design failure trend tracking
## Step 5: Design Comparative Testing
Using **comparative-evaluation**:
- Define how new versions will be compared to the current baseline
- Specify A/B test protocols for significant changes
- Define statistical significance requirements
## Step 6: Plan for Drift Detection
Using **longitudinal-measurement**:
- Define what constitutes meaningful quality drift vs. normal variance
- Design automated alerts for drift detection
- Specify the investigation and response protocol when drift is detected
## Output
Deliver a complete benchmark suite specification:
1. Benchmark goals and decision framework
2. Golden test set (20-50 inputs with expected standards)
3. Metrics definitions with baselines and thresholds
4. Failure monitoring specifications
5. Comparative testing protocol
6. Drift detection and response plan
7. Benchmark reporting template
8. Recommended automation approach
